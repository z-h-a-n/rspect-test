### Ruby Homework

This homework will help you go over what we have covered so far in Ruby but also some of the concepts we have done in JavaScript. There are 41 questions - you don't have to do every single one (although if you can, that's great). They vary in level from quite easy to fairly hard. Work through them and check if they're correct by running the specs.

You should be able to answer most questions with a couple of lines of code, and just a few methods. If you're writing a long, complex solution, there's probably a better way.

To run the specs, just run:

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
~~~

**Quick tip**: to run a single example, change `it` to `fit` on that example, then run

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb --tag focus
~~~

Good luck!

### Rules

* Try and get the RSpec tests to pass (but not by cheating - i.e. hardcoding the expected value)
* You won't need any extra libraries or gems
* The cleaner your code the better!
* Googling is fine!!!

### Tips

* Use the ruby docs!
* Try and break down the problems into smaller chunks. For e.g. if you google "How to select elements in an array that start with a", you won't have much luck. Try and find out a) how to select certain elements in an array, b) how to test if a string starts with an 'a'
* Don't forget Enumerable (advanced array methods)
* Don't panic!
